title: Lean 4 Workgroup in Toulouse
---

Hi everyone!

We have started a workgroup to learn Lean language to learn the basics of formalising mathematics, and we invite anyone interested in Toulouse to join this group. 
This website will be a repository of all the material covered in the workgroup, notes, videos, and lectures. We will also try to make the lean files available for reference. 
We hope that this will be a weekly thing, and people try to get a hands-on experience with the software. Hope to see you at the next meeting. 

Aabhas Gulati and Ion Nechita


# Upcoming Meetings


## Friday April 4th, 2:00 pm, Salle F. Pellos (1R2-207)

Everyone should formalize their favourite theorem about *vector spaces*. 


# Past Meetings 

## Friday March 28th, 2:00 pm, Salle F. Pellos (1R2-207)

Homework was to formalise your favourite theorem in Group Theory. The lean file for theorems discussed in this session are available [here](https://github.com/gulatiaabhas/leanintoulouse/blob/main/lean-files/group-theory-session.lean). Thanks to Francois! 

There are a few helpful resources, [Groups and Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/C08_Groups_and_Rings.html) and [Formalisation of basic group theory in Lean](https://tqft.net/web/notes/load.php?name=students/20180219-MitchRowett-ASC-report-on-Lean). 

## Friday March 21st, 3:15pm, Salle F. Pellos (1R2-207)
We discussed the [homework](https://github.com/gulatiaabhas/leanintoulouse/blob/main/lean-files/squeeze.lean) and we have updated the file with the proof. 

We also discussed proofs of a basic theorem in group theory 

### Theorem 

If there is a group G such that for all $x \in G$, we have $x^2 = 1$, then it implies that the group is Abelian. 

The lean file for this theorem can be found [here](https://github.com/gulatiaabhas/leanintoulouse/blob/main/lean-files/group-theory.lean)






## Friday March 14th, 2pm, Salle F. Pellos (1R2-207)

[Lean4 cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madvorak/lean4-cheatsheet/main/lean-tactics.pdf)

We went line by line through some simple proofs involving [even](https://github.com/gulatiaabhas/leanintoulouse/blob/main/lean-files/even.lean) numbers. 

We decided on a [homework](https://github.com/gulatiaabhas/leanintoulouse/blob/main/lean-files/squeeze.lean) for next time, following the lemma from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2zaPoj3G50).




## Friday March 7th, 2pm, FERMI seminar room 

Introductions and set-up. The main webpage for [Lean 4](https://leanprover-community.github.io/)

Installation instructions: 
- Follow these instructions to get your lean up and working [Install Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html#regular-install)
- Then follow these steps to create your first lean project [Set up a project](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html)

The [Natural Number Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4) is a good place to start when learning the basics of Lean. 

We briefly saw the proof of: composition of two surjective functions is surjective [lean file](https://github.com/gulatiaabhas/leanintoulouse/blob/main/lean-files/surjective.lean)
