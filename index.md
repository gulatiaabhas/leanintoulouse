Hey guys!

Me and Ion Nechita have started a workgroup to learn Lean in Toulouse! 

This website will be used as a repository of the helpful content we find online. It might also feature recordings of the sessions (if its possible to do so), and the important learning outcomes of each session. Anyone who is a participant in the workgroup can contribute to this website.
